# Plant-Classification using Random Forest-Based Classifier and Support Vector Maachine

All Instructions are included in their repective files. I suggest using the Jupyter Notebook as this is the most detailed with regards to how this model was constructed.

Dataset_formatting.py - creates the dataset of features using the ImageMethods.py file.

SamplePlant.jpg - This image is used as a sample in the Jupyter Notebook.

The graph file shows the comparison od the RFC with the SVM classifier.

PlantFeature.csv - This is the dataset used to train the classification models.

Final plant classification model (jupyter) - explains all the coding used in the project
